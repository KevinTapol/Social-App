1. Add a delete button and delete ability to each comment wich is only visible to the user who submitted the comment.
model -> controller -> router -> server.js -> views

when you make changes in your ejs you must restart the server.js

req.user vs req.params
request body vs request pathing





2. Add the username associated with each comment to the comment text

- find the username based on the user ID attached to the comment

-model
- DB storage of the user ID who created the comment
When adding a new feature best practice is to start at the model
in Comment.js models add createdById to compare to currently logged in user req.user to later enable delete button - the reason being that if a user can change their name, we are comparing the unique id instead of user name
also add createdBy in Comment.js models

-controller
- The user who created the comment's ID
in controllers folder posts.js changed the method getPost sorted order to asc from desc
in controllers folder comments.js createComment method add createdBy and createdById

- a controller with a delete method

create a delete comment method called deleteComments in the file comments.js in the controller folder

- routes
create a route for the deleteComments 


- views post.ejs
- a button
- a conditional statement in the view that compares the logged in user with the comment user ID
